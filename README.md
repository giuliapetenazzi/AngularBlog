# Angular Blog

Web app that represents a blog, showing details about posts and comments, using Angular.

This single page application, developed using Angular 11, implements a simple Blog using the APIs provided by https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com.
Posts page shows a list of posts, and clicking on one of them, the user can see comments regarding that post, and can insert a new comment.
I used Angular Material and flexbox for styling the application layout and a loader indicator to handle the loading states.
Pages are served passing through a simple login page, with remember me flag to keep the user logged in using cookies.
